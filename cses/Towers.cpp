/*
this can also be done using multiset or a direct upper bound search
Letâ€™s say x is [3, 5, 7] and we want to place z = 4 in x to maintain sorted order:
Using binary search, we find that the smallest position where 4 could be placed is at index 1 (since x[1] = 5).
This means 4 can replace 5 in x, resulting in x = [3, 4, 7].
